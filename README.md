### Working rules
1. Never push directly to `main`
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b yourname-feature`, where yourname is your name and feature is the part of the project you are working on.
3. Push: `git push origin yourname-feature`
4. Open a Pull Request → wait for approval
5. After merge, pull the new main: `git pull origin main`

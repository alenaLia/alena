                    <h3>What is OpenSeat?</h3>
                    <p>
                        OpenSeat is a crowdsourced platform that helps Stevens students find available study spaces 
                        in the library. By reporting crowd levels on each floor, students help each other make informed 
                        decisions about where to study.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Students Report:</strong> When you're in the library, take a moment to report how crowded your floor is using the quick form on the homepage or by scanning a QR code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Updates:</strong> Your report is combined with others to show real-time crowd averages for each floor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Find Your Spot:</strong> Check the homepage before heading to the library to see which floors have space available.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
                    <p>
                        Finding a quiet study spot during exam season can be frustrating. We built OpenSeat to save 
                        students time and reduce the stress of wandering between floors looking for an open seat.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Technology</h3>
                    <p>
                        OpenSeat is built with simple, accessible web technologies:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript</li>
                        <li>No frameworks or build tools required</li>
                        <li>Hosted on GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting</li>
                        <li>Mobile-first, responsive design</li>
                        <li>Accessible to all students, including those using assistive technologies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Privacy & Data</h3>
                    <p>

                        used solely to display aggregate crowd levels.
                    </p>
